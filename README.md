## Introduction 
personal machine/distro : 
- thinkpad t460
- arch linux

dotfiles are for the following stack :
-htop
- alacritty
- tmux
- zsh
- neovim

## Installation
The following installations assumes you already have installed the stack above.  
**Warning:**   
This is a very personal setup, and I doubt it (b/c its just configuration files), but installation scripts may not work.   
I have not tested on other machines or distros.
